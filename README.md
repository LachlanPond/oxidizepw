# Oxidizepw
A simple command line password manager I'm developing to learn the basics of Rust.

[!CAUTION]
While Oxidizepw is just now beginning to implement encryption and password hashing, I've made no attempt to ensure this is done in an air-tight manner. I'm not a cryptography expert, I'm just making this to learn Rust.
